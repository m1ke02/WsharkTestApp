Test firmware project for Woodenshark nRF51 development board.

The board has 2 LEDs and 2 buttons. 
Our goal is to create BLE service with 2 characteristics, one for reading button click count and the other for LED control.

To compile this project place it in <NRF51_SDK>/examples/ble_peripheral folder.
